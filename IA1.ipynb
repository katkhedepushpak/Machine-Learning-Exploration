These weights typically correspond with what one would expect to see in reality. For instance, as would be expected logically, features like more rooms and appealing views consistently have positive weights.\n","\n","The analysis brought up two interesting surprises. First, it turns out that older houses are often more expensive than newer ones, which goes against what most people think. This could be because older houses have unique features or historical value. Second, having a larger living space doesn't always mean a higher price. In fact, it can sometimes make the price lower, which is not what we usually expect.

Question\n","\n","Which learning rate leads to the best trainng and validation MSE respectively? Do you observe better training MSE tend to correpsond to better validation MSE? How is this different from the trend shown in slide 43 (titled danger of using training loss to select M) discussed in class regarding overfitting? Is there any issue with using training loss to pick learning rate in this case?"],"metadata":{"id":"QLewEsdZbShd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Answer:** The lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), for both training and validation datasets, is produced by a learning rate of 0.1 (i.e., LR = 0.1), according to observations for the best learning rate. This shows that the model performs best in terms of MSE on both the data it was trained on and new, unseen data when the learning rate is set to 0.1 during the training process. This result suggests that the selected learning rate is appropriate for the particular model and dataset and strikes a good balance between underfitting and overfitting.\n","\n","Positive trend exists between higher training MSE and higher validation MSE. Improvements in training performance indicate an overall improvement in model performance, indicating that the model generalizes well to new data. In machine learning, this alignment is a desired result because it shows that the model isn't overfitting the training data.\n","\n","This scenario, however, is distinct from the overfitting scenario depicted in slide 43 (\"danger of using training loss to select M\") that was discussed in class. In that slide, the validation loss begins to increase after initially being very similar to the training loss. This phenomenon shows that the model starts to overfit as it learns and improves its performance on the training data, which lowers its performance on the validation data. This emphasizes the danger of choosing model parameters solely based on training loss. Here based on our experimented LR's it is not visible and holds not true.\n","\n","Lower MSE values for the training and validation datasets as a result of the chosen learning rate, LR = 0.1, show effective generalization. Therefore, choosing the learning rate based primarily on the training loss seems like a wise decision in this particular situation. It's important to stress that these results might not be applicable to all datasets and models. To make sure that the model is properly tuned and resistant to overfitting, it is still critical to use supplemental techniques like cross-validation and ongoing monitoring of the validation loss. Additionally, the ideal learning rate can change depending on the features of the dataset and the particulars of the issue being solved."],"metadata":{"id":"LH2gZ8aLkRq9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Part 3.

Why?"],"metadata":{"id":"PPYb-oTeFt8B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Answer:** Normalization using zscore can help to provide positive influence over lower MSE on both sets as data is adjusted in a similar scale. Also, using this helps achieve faster convergence and outputs an improved generalization. It plays a pivotal role in balancing feature scales, enhancing convergence speed, improving generalization, and making your model more interpretable and robust. The combined impact of these advantages is bound to elevate the performance and reliability of your predictive models.\n","\n","The learned model's weights will have a different magnitude after normalization. The weights will be affected by the scaling of features when they are centered around their mean and scaled by a factor (). The correlation between the normalized features and the target variable will be reflected in the weights. In particular, weights will have a magnitude based on the effect of the corresponding feature on the target variable. Normalization scales down the feature, but the weight continues to signify the strength of the connection.\n","\n","Normalization plays a crucial role in enhancing the convergence process of Batch Gradient Descent in several key ways. To begin, it promotes a stable learning rate, which is vital for the success of Gradient Descent techniques, including Batch Gradient Descent. Normalization ensures that the learning rate remains consistent across various features, thus preventing the algorithm from making abrupt and erratic moves, ultimately leading to faster convergence. Additionally, normalization reduces the algorithm's sensitivity to the initial weight values. This means that the optimization process becomes less prone to getting stuck in local minimum points, resulting in a more efficient and dependable convergence process.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"liLbn0htPA3v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now please perform the following experiments to verify your answer to the above questions.\n","1.

Initially, I thought that using a method like z-scores to normalize the data would lead to a decrease in the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both my training and validation sets. I also believed it would help my model learn faster and become more accurate in making predictions. My idea is validated here with the expectation as MSE of training increased from 14.39 to 172.66 and MSE of validation is increased to 14.28 to 192.508 which conforms the assumption that normalization helps reduce the MSE. Additionally, the weights of my model became smaller after normalization, which is something I anticipated as a result of feature scaling. But what really surprised me was that my model didn't seem to learn any faster, as I had hoped it would. These findings highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the data and the choice of normalization techniques, as they can have unexpected effects on the model's performance."],"metadata":{"id":"lAiBYtRZROtt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **3(b).

For example, there are multiple squared footage related features that are strongly correlated (e.g., *sqft_above* and *sqrt_living* has a correlation coefficient of 0.878).  This is referred to as multicollinearity phenomeon, where two or more features are correlated.\n","\n","There are numerous consequences from multicollinearity. It makes it more challenging to estimate the weights of the features accurately. The weights may become unstable, and their interpretation becomes less clear.\n","\n","In this part you will start with the pre-processed training set, and perform the following experiments **using the closed-form solution**.\n","Specifically, your code should:\n","1. randomly subsample 75% percent of the training data (with normalized features) for five times\n","2. creating five slighly different training sets that are 75% of the original training set size.\n","3. for each such training set, perform learning using the closed-form solution and report the learned weight vector in a

like the weight coefficient to be stable across slightly different runs. Which features have the most stable weights across different runs? Which features have the least stable weights across different runs? Can you relate the stability of the features in relation to the multicollinearity issue we have for this dataset?"],"metadata":{"id":"vodiypKgh26u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Answer:** Most stable weights are shown by long, view, grade, yr_built, zipcode, age_since_renovated features, sqft_living15 , sqft_lot15 . Least stablility was shown by sqft_living, bedrooms, sqft_long, etc. Yes, the stablity of weights have a influence with multicolinearity. From our experiment, we learned that when some of our data features are closely related (multicollinearity), it confuses the model. This confusion makes the weights it assigns to these features jump around a lot, creating instability in those weight values. We saw this in the features with the least stable weights. This instability made it hard to understand how each feature affected our model's predictions, and it also made the model less accurate in making those predictions.  \n","In conclusion, our experiment revealed that multicollinearity, which occurs when features in the dataset are highly correlated, can pose significant challenges for our model. This challenge was evident in the unstable weights assigned to the correlated features, making it difficult to interpret their individual effects."],"metadata":{"id":"3xc4Aik1ikzE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Bonus.
